Welcome! Please note this experiment is still under construction as of 1 Sep 2023.

## Experiment description
This experiment represents a flat-bottom channel initialized with a balanced & baroclinically unstable
density field. This initialization is generated from ECCOv4 data in the Beaufort gyre region.
Simple linear stability analysis on the raw ECCO data implies a Phillips like BI regime, one that
originates in the fluid interior. This setup captures some aspects of an eddy field generated through
this mechanism.

The experiment is forced and dissipated. Dissipation is standard (Leith), while the forcing is
a restoring everwhere determined by the difference between channel mean (2d) fields and initial fields.
